/* Hi there! This is a _fork_ of Remote2D, hopefully designed
 * to address some of the inefficiencies of the original version
 * and thus to serve as an improvement. It is currently a proof-
 * of-concept, and is not intended for commercial use.
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 * Remote2D is the basic class that initializes all of the other
 * components of the editor and the engine.
 * In Remote2D, the editor runs separately and pulls in 
 * functionality from the engine classes, like Physics, Audio,
 * Renderer, et cetera. Both groups, the engine and the editor, 
 * exist in parallel to each other and are not the same. In
 * addition, the entity system is designed with respect to the
 * engine being responsible for functionality, so that entities
 * are _not responsible for rendering themselves_, and that
 * everything can be neatly parallelized.
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 * The original engine was created by Adrian Biagioli and can
 * be found at his GitHub repository:
 * - https://github.com/Flafla2/Remote2D-Engine
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 * The source code for this engine can be found at the GitHub
 * repository:
 * - https://github.com/Prince781/Remote2D
 * 
 * With that, we hope that you may find our version to be 
 * useful.
 * - Ben and Princeton
